I built a desktop tool that turns Teamworks AMS CMJ exports into clean, print-ready radar charts for every athlete. The workflow used to be manual; now coaches can select one or more CSVs, click Run, and instantly get a multi-page PDF plus optional PNGs. It calculates per-date percentiles across athletes, then overlays each test date as its own polygon so trends are obvious at a glance. The stack is Python with tkinter for the GUI, pandas/numpy for data, matplotlib for charts, and PyInstaller for cross-platform packaging. Releases are fully automated with GitHub Actions for both macOS and Windows builds. Everything runs locally—no uploads—so data stays private on the coach’s machine.
